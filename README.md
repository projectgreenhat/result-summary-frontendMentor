# Frontend Mentor - Results summary component solution

Not a very neat CSS ðŸ˜….
Slightly different from the orignal preview but still im pretty proud of it cuz it helped me use a lot of css styling principle that i learnt yesterday.
Also i have to practise more around how to make it more responsive.
i have use em unit alot in this one next time i tink i'll use vh to maintain the responsiveness and constraint between elements.
Not very proud of this but just want to submit it right now i might upload a better versio later.
